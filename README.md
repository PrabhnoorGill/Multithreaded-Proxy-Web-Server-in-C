HTTP Server in C

This repository contains an HTTP server implemented in C, designed to run on Unix-based systems. The server is capable of handling GET requests and has been developed as a project to study various operating system concepts such as LRU cache, threading, and semaphores.
Features

    Handles GET requests
    Multi-threaded architecture
    Implements LRU cache
    Uses semaphores for synchronization

Prerequisites

    Unix-based operating system
    GCC compiler


Concepts Studied

This project was primarily a study in various operating system concepts:

    LRU Cache: Implemented to efficiently manage and cache HTTP responses.
    Threading: Utilized to handle multiple client requests concurrently.
    Semaphores: Used for managing synchronization between threads.
